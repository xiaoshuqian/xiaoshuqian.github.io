Every computer software system has an architecture, even
if it is an ad hoc architecture. Modern software systems are
larger, include more interoperability of their components,
and often involve many programmers and engineers, working together to achieve a predictable design. When there is
no coherent architecture for the design, the engineers and
programmers often find themselves working at cross-purposes, constantly reworking their product to satisfy previously
undefined requirements. This class is focused on the high-level
concern of the architecture of a software system. Therefore,
we will not be doing any computer programming. The course
interests will include the requirements development, system
context, and relationships between the various components
and structures in a software architecture. At the end of this
course students will be prepared to participate in a software
(or systems) engineering project at the high level of development where they design the fundamental architecture for that
system. Students will understand requirements development,
project strategies and tactics, patterns of architecture, and
architectural styles and idioms.
