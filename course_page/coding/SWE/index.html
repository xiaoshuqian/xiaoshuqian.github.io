            Description
        </h4>
        <p>
        From ITU course catalog: In this class, students will learn the elements of engineering
and the relationship of engineering to software practice.
It also covers how those principles and practices apply to
the design, development, and maintenance of software
throughout the entire software lifecycle. The course introduces
traditional and contemporary approaches to software engineering practice. These include: requirements development,
architecture and detailed design, modeling, testing strategies,
process selection, project management, how to interact with
other engineers on large-scale systems, and more. This course
includes a capstone team where students gain practical experience designing a software system from start to finish using
software modeling techniques such as UML, as well as a
variety of project management methods and tools. This is not
a programming course, but a background in object-oriented
programming (OOP) will be valuable in helping the student
understand the demands of the capstone project.
