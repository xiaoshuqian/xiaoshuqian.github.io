        <p>
        It has become increasingly important for engineering students working in the areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, digital communications and multimedia to be proficient in solving both numerical and non-numerical problems using programming languages. Many companies now use coding challenges to screen job candidates. This course describes effective problem solving strategies and illustrates solving typical coding challenge problems using these strategies. The students will complete many programming exercises provided to master these techniques. The main strategies covered include divide-and-conquer, greedy, dynamic programming, backtracking, branch-and-bound and space-time-trade-off. They will used to illustrate solving problem examples from computer science, artificial intelligence, data science, and many others.
