      <li>A pre-order or quasi-order is transitive and reflexive
      </li>
      <li>An equivalence relation is a symmetric pre-order
      </li>
      <li>A (non-strict) partial order is an anti-symmetric pre-order (&le;)
        <ul>
          <li>Anti-symmetric: aRb and bRa implies a = b
          </li>
          <li>Poset: a partially ordered set
          </li>
          <li>Lattice: a partially ordered set where every two elements has a least upper bound (joint &or;) and greatest lower bound (meet &and;)
            <ul>
              <li>meet (joint) defined above is commutative, associative and idempotent
              </li>
              <li>Conversely, we can define meet as a commutative, associative and idempotent relation and use it to define a partial order: a &le; b iff a &and; b = a
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A strict partial order can be defined by partial order: a &lt; b is defined by: a &le; b and a &ne; b
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A (non-strict) total order is a partial order (&le;) that exists for every pair of the set
        <ul>
          <li>Trichotomous: for every pair (a, b) exactly one of aRb, bRa and a = b is true
          </li>
          <li>A strict total order can be defined by total order: a &lt; b is defined by: a &le; b and a &ne; b
          </li>
