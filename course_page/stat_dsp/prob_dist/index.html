    <li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-binomial_distribution#Beta-binomial_as_an_urn_model>Urn model</a> is good for modeling binomial, hypergeometric and beta-binomial distributions.
    </li>
    <li>Arrival processe and 'successes in repeated trials' are good models for binmomial (Bernoulli), NB (Geometric), Poisson, Gamma (Exponential) and Beta distributions. Binomial and NB become Poisson and Gamma respectively when the observation time goes from discrete to continuous. Beta and Gamma can be used to model respectively success rate in repeated trials and success rate over continous time, where the parameters a and b in Beta and Gamma distributions can be interpreted respectively as 'a successes out of b trials' and 'a successes over duration b'.
      <ul>
        <li>Discrete (Num of trials): Num of arrivals out of n trials or number of extra (in addition to m) trials to get m arrivals
          <ul>
            <li>Binomial(n,p) / Bernoulli(p): mean np, variance np(1-p)
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/negative_binomial.pdf">Neg-Binomial(m,p)</a> / Geometric(p):
              <ul>
                <li>var(NB) = mq/p<sup>2</sup> = m * var(geometric_variable), where q = 1-p. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>The variance expression above is applicable regardless of which of the two definitions below is used since the two definitions differ by a constant offset.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Defn 1: X = # of trials at which the m<sup>th</sup> success occurs.
                  <ul>
                    <li>mean = m/p, since p is the success rate and thus 1/p is the average number of trials needed to get one success.
                    </li>
                    <li>pmf = C(x-1,m-1)p<sup>m</sup>q<sup>x-m</sup>, since the probability of getting (m-1) successes in (x-1) trials is C(x-1,m-1)p<sup>m-1</sup>q<sup>x-m</sup>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Defn 2: X = # of failures before the m<sup>th</sup> success.
                  <ul>
                    <li>mean = mq/p, since the two definitions are related by X1 = X2 + m and thus, mean1 = m/p = mean2 + m or mean2 = mq/p.
                    </li>
                    <li>p = m/(mean + m) = #Succ / (#Succ + #Fail)
                    </li>
                    <li>var = mean + mean<sup>2</sup>/m or m = mean/(var - mean<sup>2</sup>). Thus, the var is always bigger than mean (unlike Poison variable whose var = mean). Note that for a Poisson variable with a gamma conjugate prior for its mean, its prior predictive distribution is NB. As the prior distribution becomes more and more concentrated around the mean, the NB approaches the Posson and vice versa.
                    </li>
                    <li>pmf = C(m+x-1,x)p<sup>m</sup>q<sup>x</sup>, since the probability of getting (m-1) successes in (m+x-1) trials is C(m+x-1,m-1)p<sup>m-1</sup>q<sup>x</sup>.

                    <li>The range of X is non-negative integers.
                    </li>
                    <li>No need for m to appear at the bottom of combinatorial coefficient and thus it is easy to generalize m to all non-negative reals.
