        <li>Science:
          <ul>
            <li> Human brain is wired to react to unfairness with indignation, resulting in impaired judgement (logical thinking). So don't beat yourself for feeling angry. After all, this is a natural response. Focus on a wise response.
            </li>
            <li>Everyone plays by their own rules and believes their own rules are the fair ones. These rules are formed by one's own up-bringing and are very hard if not impossible for others to change.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Catch yourself when detecting unfairness and stop reacting right away. Momentarily exitricate yourself from the situation if possible. Otherwise try to take a deep breath and free your thoughts from the situation even for just a moment
        </li>
        <li>Assess the situation: Did you really lose anything? What's the impact? If not, try to focus on something more positive and productive. Otherwise, try to formulate a strategy to best address the situation
        </li>
        <li>Sometimes, better choosing healthy than right

        </li>
        <li>Week1: Using your <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Strengths_and_Virtues>character strengths</a>
          <ul>
            <li>Here character strength is defined as strengths that are fullfiling and intrinsically valuable (see <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Strengths_and_Virtues>wiki</a>). Thus, using these strengths improve your well-being.

        <li>Week 2: Act to counter misconceptions about happiness
          <ul>
            <li>Knowing is not nearly half the battle. Act: write gratitude journal, practice savoring, applying your strength
            </li>
            <li>Our minds' strongest intuitions are sometimes wrong and knowing it may not change your intuition. e.g. Ponzo illusion
            </li>
            <li>People are very adaptive: predicted happyness and sadness are often proved to be exagerated. Act: Enjoy the process and do not get overly fixated on the result
              <ul>
                <li>People will often demand higher salary regardless of their current salary.

            <li>Our intuitions are often wrong
            </li>
            <li>Our minds are built to get used to things
            </li>
            <li>We often don't realize that our minds are built to get used to things
