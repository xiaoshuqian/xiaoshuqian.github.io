    <li>Alternative itinerary driving from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas:
      <ul>
        <li>Salt Lake City --3h 37m--> Arche --10m--> Molab
        </li>
        <li>Molab: Natural Bridges (2h 20m), Canyonland (36m), Capitol Reef (2h 19m)
        </li>
        <li>Capitol Reef --2h 20m--> Bryce Canyon (add 21m if via scenic byway 12 and stop at Escalante)
          <ul>
            <li>The more accessible attractions of Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument are between Bolder Utah and Escalante. However, other than a few outlooks, scenic sites such as Escalante natural bridges and Escalante natural arches, are away from route 12. Some require that you hike there and some require additional drive before you start to hike.
            </li>
            <li>In contrast, Arches near Molab are better and more accessible
